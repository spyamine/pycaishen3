# findatapy

findatapy creates an easy to use Python API to download market data from many sources including Quandl, Bloomberg, Yahoo, Google etc. using
a unified high level interface. Users can also define their own custom tickers, using configuraiton files. There is also functionality which
is particularly useful for those downloading FX market data. Below example shows how to download AUDJPY data from Quandl (and automatically 
calculates this via USD crosses).

```
from findatapy.market import Market, MarketDataRequest, MarketDataGenerator

market = Market(market_data_generator=MarketDataGenerator())

md_request = MarketDataRequest(start_date='year', category='fx', data_source='quandl', tickers=['AUDJPY'])

df = market.fetch_market(md_request)
print(df.tail(n=10))
```

Here we see how to download tick data from DukasCopy, wih the same API calls and minimal changes in the code.

```
md_request = MarketDataRequest(start_date='14 Jun 2016', finish_date='15 Jun 2016',
                                   category='fx', fields=['bid', 'ask'], freq='tick', 
                                   data_source='dukascopy', tickers=['EURUSD'])

df = market.fetch_market(md_request)
print(df.tail(n=10))
```

I had previously written the open source PyThalesians financial library. This new findatapy library has similar functionality to the 
market data part of that library. However, I've totally rewritten the API to make it much cleaner and easier to use. It is also now a fully
standalone package, so you can more easily use it with whatever libraries you have for analysing market data or doing your backtesting (although I'd recommend
my own finmarketpy package if you are doing backtesting of trading strategies!).

A few things to note:
* Please bear in mind at present findatapy is currently a highly experimental alpha project and isn't yet fully 
documented
* Uses Apache 2.0 licence

# Requirements

Major requirements
* Required: Python 3.4, 3.5
* Required: pandas, numpy etc.
* Recommended: Bloomberg Python Open API
    * To use Bloomberg you will need to have a licence (either to access Desktop API or Server API)
    * Use experimental Python 3.4 version from Bloomberg http://www.bloomberglabs.com/api/libraries/
    * Also download C++ version of Bloomberg API and extract into any location
        * eg. C:\blp\blpapi_cpp_3.9.10.1
    * For Python 3.5 - need to compile blpapi source using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 yourself
        * Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 (Community Edition is free)
        * Before doing do be sure to add environment variables for the Bloomberg DLL (blpapi3_64.dll) to PATH variable
            * eg. C:\blp\blpapi_cpp_3.9.10.1\bin
        * Make sure BLPAPI_ROOT root is set as an environmental variable in Windows
            * eg. C:\blp\blpapi_cpp_3.9.10.1
        * python setup.py build
        * python setup.py install
    * For Python 3.4 - prebuilt executable can be run, which means we can skip the build steps above
        * Might need to tweak registry to avoid "Python 3.4 not found in registry error" (blppython.reg example) when using this executable 
    * The library doesn't support the old Bloomberg COM API (since much slower than the new Open API)
* Recommended: chartpy for funky interactive plots (https://github.com/cuemacro/chartpy) and
* Recommended: arctic (AHL library for managing time series in MongoDB)
* Recommended: multiprocessor_on_dill because standard multiprocessing library pickle causes issues 
(from https://github.com/sixty-north/multiprocessing_on_dill)

# Installation

You can install the library using the below. After installation:
* Make sure you edit the DataConstants class for the correct Quandl API and Twitter API keys

```
pip install git+https://github.com/cuemacro/findatapy.git
```
